	Interest and Hobbies
	</h2>
	<p>
I enjoy playing around with other people’s codes seeing what I can do to them and trying to understand how it works and creating small little tools that do random things.
</p>
<p> 
Another small thing I like to enjoy is to create and play around with Minecraft plugins, adding my own variation to already made plugins or creating new simple ones to understand how they’re features work.
</p>
<p>
My objectives are pretty simple which is to create fun and enjoyable games. I enjoy working in part of a team especially when you’re able to communicate ideas with each other.
