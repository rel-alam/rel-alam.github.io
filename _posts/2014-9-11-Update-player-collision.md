An update to the base entity was done and since the player inherits from the base entity class has broke its constructor. This was a quick fix to reflect the playerâ€™s constructor to match that given by the base entity class.

Collision manager has been modified to a simple check of a single barrier against the player.

Finally a player image has been added in so that we actually got a player on the screen instead of a box.
