A small addition was added today which were the scores and the saving of the scores. Currently the scores do not sort into the correct order and is saved to the bottom of the file.

Another addition was the ability to load sound effect files into the game but I forgot to actually add the function to play those files. This is fixed with a new play sound effect function added to the game and is currently working as it was intended.
