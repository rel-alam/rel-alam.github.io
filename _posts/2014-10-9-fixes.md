Turns out the way I was loading in the enemy again was using a list that reduced in size when the enemy dies rendering it useless for me so that saving method has been scrapped. The readers inside the loading function forgot to close and dispose them causing the file to stay open and not allowing saving to work anymore.

Added in a timer into the animation class to now make it go through each frame much slower than previously.

Changed playerâ€™s attack speed of hitting the grunt to something more reasonable and added in a splash screen state into the game.
