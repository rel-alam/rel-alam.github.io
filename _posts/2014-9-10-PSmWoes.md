PSM caused a few issues on its creation one was that if I linked in a new class it wouldn't update its userperfs or something thus when someone else downloaded it they would need to link it in themselves. After much ado it was easier to tell one of the other team members about the new file to be linked in as I couldnt figure out why mine wouldnt apply for everyone when re-uploaded back to perforce.

The player class was edited again adding in a test of using the thumb-stick control instead of the directional d-pad was quickly thrown out as the button layout catered for the use of the d-pad instead.
