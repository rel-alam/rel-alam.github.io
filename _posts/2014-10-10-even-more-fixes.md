Added in a pause state into game with the ability to quit, save, or resume.

A display bug within the splash screen was fixed as I used the wrong variable to specify the correct screen size resulting in a zoomed in image on windows and an image with black bars and the Vita. Button locations on the main menu were changed as when the quit button on the pause screen was pressed it would also trigger the quit button in the main menu quitting the program.

Added in a load button from main menu, but is currently disabled due to throwing errors of objects not existing.

Toggling music for windows has been added in. Pressing the m key would turn the music either on or off.
