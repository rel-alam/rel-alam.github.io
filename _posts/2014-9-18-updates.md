The response of the collision manager has been changed in the way it reacts when the player collides with the wall. Before it used to change its velocity but this brought in a fair amount of bugs that were annoying. Instead it has been changed to push the player back a certain amount of distance and in the opposite direction of where they are colliding with the wall. This allowed wall hugging to take place as the previous code wouldnâ€™t allow movement along the wall but now the player jitters as it is being pushed off the wall.

A game state manager was created and currently contains a base state, main menu and a state machine. The game states are functioning and work as intended with more states to be introduced. This allowed code to be cleaned up from the game.cs class and can now be more organised and separated into their correct areas such as main menu stuff in the main menu state class.
