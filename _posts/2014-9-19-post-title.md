Some small bugs such as drawing was fixed today as well as correctly outputting the right statement when a collision occurred.

A new state has been added which is the Game Play state allowing nearly all the code from the game.cs class to be moved and now is more organised. All creation of the objects and drawing is now done in GamePlayState.cs
